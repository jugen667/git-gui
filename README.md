# Git GUI 
Simple GUI for Git project management 

## IN STALE
Project is boring me, didn't expect that much rework while using the lib
Currently commits an index but not the files


## Roadmap 

- ~~Open a repo~~
- ~~Do a Git status~~
- ~~Show the git status~~
- ~~Add files~~
- Git commit with message
- Git push
- Save token and name in config

### Further
- Pull diffs
- Create a repository 
- Revert the modification
- Change/create new branches

---------------

# KNOWN BUGS 

- The binary must be placed in the repo to allow the opening doesnt work from another directory
