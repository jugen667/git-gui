# Git GUI 
Simple GUI for Git project management 


## Roadmap 

- ~~Open a repo~~
- ~~Do a Git status~~
- Show the git status (currently displaying if diffs)
- Add files (first all and then 1 by 1)
- Git commit with message
- Git push
- Save token and name in config

### Further
- Pull diffs
- Create a repository 
- Revert the modification
- Change/create new branches

---------------

# KNOWN BUGS 

- The binary must be placed in the repo to allow the opening doesnt work from another directory
